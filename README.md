## Description

This project utilizes node.js on the backend for assisting users in creating high quality README's! All information is captured via prompted questions and uses template literals to get the information across. 

## Installation 

To get this to work, users need to install the inquirer package via the command "npm init inquirer". It uses version 8.2.4.

## Usage

once the user downloads the necessary packages, they must open the integrated terminal by going over to the index.js file and right-clicking on the file. A prompt should appear saying "open in integrated terminal"... click on it and open it. From there the terminal will open, click on the terminal and type in "node index.js". in the terminal, a series of questions will pop up, all of which will feed into your README to help make an organized version of it. Once done, a readme.md will appear under the file-name "readmeoutputs". A video demoing the program can be seen below:
